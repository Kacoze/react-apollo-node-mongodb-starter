# Description
This is an SEO-friendly, fully-configured, modular starter project for developing Universal JavaScript applications. You can use our kit to create your applications in JavaScript or TypeScript for all major platforms â€“ mobile, web, and server.

This starter is built on top of Apollo, GraphQL, JWT, React 16, Redux, React Native, Expo, Mongodb, and Express. TypeScript is used across the entire project, but you can freely mix vanilla JavaScript (ES6 and ES7) and TypeScript.

The starter kit also integrates Twitter Bootstrap, Ant Design, Ant Design Mobile, Styled Components, and NativeBase to provide great possibilities for styling for your web and mobile applications.
